### Description:
This project simulates a traffic light system based on inputs from the user, providing a responsive real-time simulation of the system in different modes.
This project was completed on an STK500 / ATMega8 board. Pin allocations for the project are described below.

For further information, download the report attached.

### Pin layouts:
SW0 -> PD0
SW5 -> PD2
SW6 -> PD3
SW7 -> PD1
LED0 -> PC1
LED1 -> PC2
LED2 -> PC3
LED3 -> PC4
LED4 -> PC5
ADC Output -> PC0
PB1 = Red light camera PWM Output
PB3 = Speed monitor PWM Output
Open project in Atmel studio, flash to ATMega8 board and run.
